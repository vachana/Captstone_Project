Abstract

Large Area Landcover Mapping information is necessary for a large range of environmental applications related to climate mitigation and remediation. It can also be used to inform on value add processes, calibration, atmospheric correction, and data preparation. Satellite data can be used to distinguish treed areas from crops, grassland etc.  which will allow forestry related measures of change detection to be applied to BC forests. How can we automatically distinguish forest areas from rest of the Landcover in a Sentinel-2 scene of BC & hence determine which bands provides better accuracy? The system is designed for all satellite data but my focus data was from Sentinel2-L2A which consists of 2 satellites with multispectral imager. This sensor delivers 13 spectral bands, each of 10, 20 or 60 meters  in pixel size. The goal of this project is to build a model that will be able to predict forest areas in a multispectral image captured by a satellite and determine what spectral features produce result with better accuracy.
